-- this data was from www.practise.com
-- it is about the prices of different types of houses in Bristol between 2019 and 2022. 
-- the main SQL skills I have shown here are: data cleaning, basic queeries, agregate functions and joining 
-- I then created a visualisation of this data using POWER BI which is available to view on the another file HERE 

SELECT * ROUND(MAX(averagepropprice), 1) AS 'Average Property Price'
